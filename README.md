# Textualize

Textualize is a desktop application designed to process your photos or scans of physical text documents, convert them into textual data and translate them.

Textualize comes with an interface to edit, modify, and manage your projects, making it a powerful tool to work on entire volumes as well as single page documents.

This project is still under development. Currently on English, classic Hebrew script, and Rashi script are available options for textualizing in the GUI. 

Context linking for translations and translation output are still very much buggy and not accessible through the GUI
